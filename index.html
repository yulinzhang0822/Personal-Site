  <p align="left">I am a graduate student in the Department of Computer Science at the <a href="https://uci.edu/">University of California, Irvine</a>. I am now pursuing the degree of <a href="https://mcs.ics.uci.edu/">Master of Computer Science</a>,
    and will graduate in December, 2020. I
    will be a Software Development
    Engineer
    Intern at Amazon between June and September of 2020 in Seattle, WA. My goal is to become a full-time Full Stack Developer upon graduation. Before I attended UCI, I obtained my Bachelor degree of Computer Science at Jilin University in Changchun,
    China. The best honors I was awarded during my undergraduate career were the First Class Scholarship and Outstanding Student of College in the College of Computer Science and Technology.
